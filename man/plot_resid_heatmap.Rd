\title{Plot a heatmap of the residual pairwise dissimilarities \code{|observed - fitted|}}
\usage{
plot_resid_heatmap(datapath, mcmcpath, hm_colors = NULL, hm_scale = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{datapath}{The full path and the file name of the input \code{diffs} matrix.}

\item{mcmcpath}{A vector of EEMS output directories, for the same dataset. Warning: There is minimal checking that the directories all correspond to the same dataset.}

\item{hm_colors}{The heatmap color palette as a vector of colors, ordered from low to high. Defaults to a white-to-red palette.}

\item{hm_scale}{A fixed range for the heatmap colors. The default is NULL, so the color space is the observed range of the residuals.}
}
\description{
Given a set of EEMS output directories, this function generates a heatmap of the n-by-n matrix of residual dissimilarities between pairs of individuals. The residuals are the differences between the observed and the fitted dissimilarities; the rows and columns, which correspond to individuals, are in the same order as the samples in \code{datapath.coord} and \code{datapath.diffs}.
}
\details{
Applicable only in the case of SNP data when the observed dissimilarity matrix is computed explicitly.
